# Seed.js Architecture Example

- Component
- SASS
- Seed.js

Finely-modularized front end development with extremely light footprint. (10kb gzipped lib size)

## Getting Started

``` bash
# in case you don't have them yet:
# npm install -g grunt-cli component
npm install
component install
grunt watch
```

## TODO

Write a yeoman generator for this with a sub-generator for creating components.
